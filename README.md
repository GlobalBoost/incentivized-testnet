# Intro about Impact Protocol
Impact Protocol is one of the first chains with a hybrid consensus mechanism. It has the power of both PoW(proof of work) and PoS(proof of stake). The Impact protocol is built on a substrate framework, and it is a modular framework that allows developers to be easy and efficient. Impact follows the thought process of building a multichain future. It will have around 100 parachains connected and running in parallel, with 10000 to 100000 transactions per second.

## Incentivized Testnet

## Description:
We are offering a incentives for running the nodes for our testnet . The goal is to run a tesnet nodes both as a miner and a validators. We are the one of the first chains to have hybrid protocol following both POW and POS. Having said that we need a lot of testing to be done and fix as many bugs as possible. For this we are launching our incentivized testnet. The users need to run the nodes as miner and validator for a certain number of days to be eligible for the rewards

## Participation Requirements: 
Participants must have a basic understanding of blockchain technology and be able to run a node on the testnet. They must also complete a registration process to participate in the incentivized testnet bounty. Every participants create an issue presenting the idea and description of the dApps you are planning to build following the similar format as shown below

 - Email: 
 - Signal Username:
 - Discord Username:
 - Testnode 1 name:
 - Testnode 2 name: 
 - Tell us more about your skills and background that could be beneficial in future for Impact:
 - What do you think could be good to implement in Impact Protocol:
 - Are you planning to build anything in Impact protocol in future:

## Feedback Mechanism: 
Participants running the testnet nodes can provide feedback on the network, report bugs, and suggest improvements through a designated feedback channel.

## Deliverables:
For bug reporters, the deliverable is a well-documented issue report that accurately describes the bug, includes steps to reproduce, and assigns an appropriate severity level.

For bug fixers, the deliverable is a pull request that addresses the reported bug and includes a clear description of the problem and the proposed solution. The fix should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it resolves the issue and does not introduce any new problems.

## Reward:
The bounty reward for reporting a bug is categorized based on the severity for example something like low, medium and high
 The reward will be paid upon acceptance of the pull request and successful integration of the fix into our product.

## Timeline:
There is no set timeline for reporting or fixing bugs. However, we encourage prompt reporting and fixing of bugs to ensure the stability and security of our product.
