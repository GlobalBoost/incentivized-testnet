# Intro about Impact Protocol
Impact Protocol is one of the first chains with a hybrid consensus mechanism. It has the power of both PoW(proof of work) and PoS(proof of stake). The Impact protocol is built on a substrate framework, and it is a modular framework that allows developers to be easy and efficient. Impact follows the thought process of building a multichain future. It will have multiple parachains connected/integrated and running in parallel, with thousands of TPS

## Incentivized Testnet

## Description:
We are offering a incentives for running the nodes for our testnet . The goal is to run a tesnet nodes both as a miner and a validators. We are the one of the first chains to have hybrid protocol following both POW and POS. Having said that we need a lot of testing to be done and fix as many bugs as possible. For this we are launching our incentivized testnet. The users need to run the nodes as miner and validator for a certain number of days to be eligible for the rewards

## Participation Requirements: 
Participants must have a basic understanding of blockchain technology and be able to run a node on the testnet. They must also complete a registration process to participate in the incentivized testnet bounty. Every participants create an issue presenting the idea and description of the dApps you are planning to build following the similar format as shown below

 - Email: 
 - Signal Username:
 - Discord Username:
 - Testnode 1 name:
 - Testnode 2 name: [this is optional, as you can have at max two node running for a single user]
 - Public Key: 
 - Tell us more about your skills and background that could be beneficial in future for Impact:
 - What do you think could be good to implement in Impact Protocol:
 - Are you planning to build anything in Impact protocol in future:

## Feedback Mechanism: 
Participants running the testnet nodes can provide feedback on the network, report bugs, and suggest improvements through a designated feedback channel.

## Reward:
The bounty reward for participation in the testnet will be rewarded once the testent period is completed. We will use several tracking tools like telemetry and Grafana to calculate the uptime and reward the eligible participants.

## Timeline:
The exact timeline and details will be announced in our official channels like discord, signal, etc. Please keep an eye on our channels for latest update about the tesnet
